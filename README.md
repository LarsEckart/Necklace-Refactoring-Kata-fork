Necklace Refactoring Kata
=========================

Start with the function 'pack_necklace'. Convert it from a big if-else statement into a Chain of Responsibility pattern.

When you've been successful with that, convert the slightly harder 'pack' function.

Before that, you will probably want to write unit tests for the function. If you prefer to begin with the refactoring, there are tests on the 'with_tests' branch.
